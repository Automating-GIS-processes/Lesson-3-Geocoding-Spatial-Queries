# Lesson 3:-Geocoding & Spatial queries

# Lesson 2: Working with Geo-DataFrames in Pandas and Geopandas

**NEW!**: You can optionally (**recommended**) read these materials from a new website. Go to [https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/).

This week we will continue working [**Geopandas**](http://geopandas.org/) and learn how to do geocoding, i.e. converting addresses into coordinates or vice versa, and do spatial queries such as Point in Polygon that makes it possible to do a spatial join between two layers.
